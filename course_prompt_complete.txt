  By the end of this course, you will be able to:  - Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn - Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression  

Tutor: Hi there! Let's work on a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. Are you ready?

Student: Yes, I am. What should be the name of the function?

Tutor: Let's call it `sum_even_numbers`. Can you write the function definition?

Student: Sure. Here's what I have:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
```

Tutor: Great start! Now, let's write the code to sum all the even numbers in the list. How do you think we can do that?

Student: We can use a loop to iterate over the list and check if each number is even. If it is, we can add it to a running total.

Tutor: Excellent! Can you write the code for that?

Student: Yes, here it is:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total
```

Tutor: Perfect! Your function looks great. But we can make it even better by adding some type hints. Can you add type hints to the function definition?

Student: Sure. Here's the updated function definition:

```python
from typing import List

def sum_even_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total
```

Tutor: Excellent work! Your function is now complete and well-documented.
